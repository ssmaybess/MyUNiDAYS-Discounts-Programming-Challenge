# MyUNiDAYS-Discounts-Programming-Challenge
## Author: Sawanya Nilyok
### Programming Language: Python

I simply wrote the code that is easily understanding by itself and user-friendly. I deployed Python knowledge that I have studied so far in my Master course by mainly using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Firstly, I came with an idea of including pricing rules in the function. The tricky part was to explore the basket and apply the discount scheme for each item, hence I decided to use set and dictionary in order to get the number of item. I made each discount scheme simple with 1 line code by applying mathematics knowledge. After that I add 2 chuck codes of delivery charge and adding items.

Finally, user can basically set up the empty basket and then add items into the basket. The separate functions allow user to check the total discounted price and delivery charge. The following is an example of command.

Basket = item('')

Basket.AddItem('A')

TotalPrice = Basket.Total()

DeliveryCharge = Basket.DeliveryCharge()

OverallTotal = TotalPrice + DeliveryCharge
